Is there some public log of the warning emails, texts, etc. sent out
by the MTA in regard to incidents causing delays or other problems
with the New York subway system? I couldn't find any such record using
Google myself.

If not, I think it would be possible to create one by writing a pretty
short computer program, and I might do it. If it were well-designed,
perhaps it could prove useful to people, like lawyers or historians,
who are interested in performing a detailed examination of whether
some account of events is consistent with all available evidence of
what was happening at the relevant times and locations.
